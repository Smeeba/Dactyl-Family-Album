#### Description

This fork features a number of additional parameters not present in the original project that allow for features such as:

- Toggle for outer column between using 1.5u sized keys and 1u sized keys.
- If enabled, the rows which use 1.5u sized keys can be specified.
- Toggle for an extra row of keys for the outer column(s).
- Toggle for an extra inner column before the thumbcluster with (nrows-2) rows.
- Toggle between using the default thumb cluster, the mini thumb cluster designed by [l4u](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard), and a new thumb cluster.
- New thumb cluster that uses the same keycaps as the default, but is more compact. The thumb only has to move one position left or right from its neutral position to reach all the keys. 
- Removable controller board / TRRS jack holder as a separate part. This holder is then friction fit into a cutout on the back wall of the case. Designed for common TRRS breakout boards.
