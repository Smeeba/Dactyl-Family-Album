# Dactyl-Family-Album

Welcome to the Dactyl Family Album! This repository was made to serve as a place to look at all of the different designs and iterations people have made based on or inspired by the [Dactyl Keyboard](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard). As this page is made to highlight different designs and innovations, slight modifications won't be featured in the main page, but instead be featured in the [Addendum page](./Addendum.md). If you desire to add an entry onto either the main page or addendum, feel free to open up a pull request or issue, using the templates found in the [Templates Page](./Templates.md) for new additions.
